# Kathmandu-Tal

### 4.4.2014

Departure was set at 6:30am this morning at our hotel. Alex and I took a taxi to
go to the bus station where we would leave to Besishahar. The trip took roughly
6 hours and shaky. But we arrived to the city which marked the gate of the
Annapurna. The second part of the trip should be done by Jeep as bus rides
stopped at Besishahar. While having a tea at a random place, we met a friendly
group of Israeli who were ready to share the trip with us towards Chame.

The town was located at 2710m high and would be the start of our trek. However,
we had lost a bit of time to gather a team and find a driver. The night quickly
fell, earlier than expected. Our driver stopped at Syange were fortunately we
could find a lodge to spend the night. The lodge was actually quite nice given
the its location. The decision was made to start at 7.00am the following day and
reach Tal (1700m) by Jeep and then start our walk until Chame. The long hours
sitting inside the Jeep made me impatient to finally get on my feet and give the
Himalaya a try. Tomorrow would be the first test with 18km distance and 1000m of
ascending elevation.
